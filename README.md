# School_District_Analysis
Use Python and Pandas library to analyze school district data
## Overview
In this projects, we are going to analyze the test data for each students at each school, to showcase the school performance trends and patterns, and finally write up a report to describe how the school budgets, size and type influence the school performance, this report will be a reference to the school board to make decisions for schools distribution.<br/>
However, there shows academic dishonesty in Thomas High School ninth graders, so we need replace their math and reading scores with NaN, and repeat the school district analysis to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
## Resources
Data source: schools_complete.csv,  students_complete.csv<br/>
Software: Python 3.7.6   Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8
## Results Analysis
1. Replace the 9th grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School with NaN:<br/>

2. Repeat the school district analysis according to the following metrics:<br/>
  -	District summary
  -	School summary
  -	Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools on overall passing rate
  -	Average math and reading scores for each grade level from each school
  -	Scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
### District summary

From the pictures ,we can see that
### School summary

As we can see
### Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools on ovrall passing rate
Top 5 performing schools before changes:<br/>

Before and after replacing the ninth-graderâ€™s math and reading scores, Thomas High School remains in second place in the top performing schools. While before, Thomas High School was closer to Cabrera High School, now Thomas High School is closer to Griffin High School in performance.
### Average math and reading scores for each grade level from each school
Average math and reading scores before changes:<br/>
